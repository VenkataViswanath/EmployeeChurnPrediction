Retaining current employees is more difficult for the HR team than recruiting new ones. Any business that loses one of its valuable employees suffers a loss in terms of productivity, time, money, and other factors. This loss could be reduced if HR could able to foresee future employees who were considering leaving their positions; as a result, we looked into ways to address the employee turnover issue from a machine learning perspective. When the time comes to lay off workers as part of organizational changes, the corporation can use churn modeling to make a rational decision rather than randomly selecting layoff candidates. Using supervised and classification-based methods like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging classifier, AdaBoost classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Artificial Neural Network we have created machine learning models. The models are trained with the Employee Attrition dataset retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/hr-employee-attrition and later fine-tuned to boost the performance of the models.
